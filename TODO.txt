Done!
=====
GLFW
Editor Class
Windows App
AntTweakBar integrate
Accept Editor resolution from WinMain, create accessors
Console write, Scroll, select for copy
Integrate FMod (?  statically linked?, alternatives?) - Mp3.cpp !! Awesome
Load music
Play Demo (Add Toolbar window)
Switch to Imgui!
 - Get a test bed (glfw3)
 - Integrate Imgui (glfw_render_thingo)
 - Play
 - now integrate with deframework
Add timeline Window
 - draw song time
 - allow scrubbing
 - KeyFrameHandle (Type, Position)
 - KeyFrame (Time, Type, Value, HanldeIn, HandleOut)
Animation Class
 - Animations (Object, Property, PropertyType(float/bool/int/double), List of Keyframes)
 - Implement InsertKeyframe
 - Implement DeleteKeyframe
 - Test it out in the editor (Dopesheet -> keymebool, not working - debug)
 - Debug Linear interpolation!
 - Cubic Catmull Rom interpolation (with auto handles)
ShaderProgram Class (from old framework)

TODO!
=====
* All Initialization happens at the start of the demo, this means scrubbing will work without issues.
* Eigen as the maths lib

Bugs!
=====
Reducing size of curve editor window crashes application
Windows 10 display scaling isn't taking into account, the whole editor is too small if display scaling is set bigger than 100% under windows 10
