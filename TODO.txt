NOTES
=====
* All Initialization to happen at the start of the demo, this means scrubbing will work without issues.

TODO!
=====
 - Material File format (.mat) Shader (filename), Textur2D (filename)
 - Assets (Meshes, Textures, Materials, Shaders)
   - Demo needs to load, use and reference.
 - Create EImage
 - Create ELight

 - Keyframe Vec3
 - Keyframe Quat

 - Entity Selection
 - Create Entity
 - Delete Entity
 - Drag and drop parenting

 - Show keyframes for selected
 - Add keyframe for selected
 - Deleted keyframe for selected

 - Load
 - Save

 - Properties for selected Layer
 - Properties for selected Keyframe
 - Properties for Material

 - Properties for Materials

 - Shadows

 - PBR Shader

Bugs!
=====
Reducing size of curve editor and timeline window crashes application
Windows 10 display scaling isn't taking into account, the whole editor is too small if display scaling is set bigger than 100% under windows 10

Sprint 2
========
Zoom timeline Window
Scroll timeline Window

Done!
=====
GLFW
Editor Class
Windows App
AntTweakBar integrate
Accept Editor resolution from WinMain, create accessors
Console write, Scroll, select for copy
Integrate FMod (?  statically linked?, alternatives?) - Mp3.cpp !! Awesome
Load music
Play Demo (Add Toolbar window)
Switch to Imgui!
 - Get a test bed (glfw3)
 - Integrate Imgui (glfw_render_thingo)
 - Play
 - now integrate with deframework
Add timeline Window
 - draw song time
 - allow scrubbing
 - KeyFrameHandle (Type, Position)
 - KeyFrame (Time, Type, Value, HanldeIn, HandleOut)
Animation Class
 - Animations (Object, Property, PropertyType(float/bool/int/double), List of Keyframes)
 - Implement InsertKeyframe
 - Implement DeleteKeyframe
 - Test it out in the editor (Dopesheet -> keymebool, not working - debug)
 - Debug Linear interpolation!
 - Cubic Catmull Rom interpolation (with auto handles)
ShaderProgram Class (from old framework)
Demoview (Editor)
Assets
 - Mp3
 - Texture
 - Shaders
Mesh
glTF
 - Use Eigen to setup model, view (camera) and projection matrices *** FAIL *** swap to glm as docs and examples are better
 - Setup mesh to create VAO from loaded model
 - Create shader that uses simple diffuse lighting
 - Render
 - Layers
 - Layer Selection
 - Create Layer
 - Delete Layer
 - Order Layer
 - Properties
 - Entities - Name, Type, Transform, Active, Children, Parent
 - Entity Abstract Base Class
 - Create EMesh
